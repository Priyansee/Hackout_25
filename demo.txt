# Blockchain-Based Green Hydrogen Credit Tracking System

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a **transparent, traceable, and fraud-proof system** for tracking green hydrogen credits using blockchain technology. It enables producers, regulators, and investors to verify hydrogen production, trade credits securely, and access verifiable compliance data in real-time.

---

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Hydrogen Digital Passport (Traceability Layer)
- Each hydrogen credit is represented as a **smart-contract-backed digital token**.
- Passport provides **origin, certification, and lifecycle information**.
- Users can explore and verify tokens via a **dashboard similar to Etherscan**.

### 2. Fraud-Proof Credit Exchange (Marketplace Layer)
- Hydrogen credits are tokenized into **NFTs (ERC-721)** and can be **fractionalized (ERC-1155)**.
- Only **verified users** (via **DID-based KYC**) can trade, preventing double counting or ghost entities.

### 3. Regulator & Investor API + Dashboard (Transparency Layer)
- Provides **REST APIs** for regulators and investors to access verifiable compliance data.
- Dashboard displays:
  - **Live map of hydrogen projects**
  - **Credit flows**
  - **Encrypted certification documents**

---

## Technical Stack

- **Blockchain / DLT:** Ethereum or Polygon (optionally Hyperledger)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (ERC-721 & ERC-1155, role-based access for issuance, transfer, retirement)
- **MERN Stack:**
  - **MongoDB** for metadata storage
  - **Express + Node.js** for REST APIs
  - **React** for dashboards and marketplace UI
- **Digital Identity:** DID-based KYC for producers and buyers
- **Secure Cloud Storage:** IPFS + AWS S3 with AES encryption
- **Data Security:** End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

## Project Deliverables

### 1. Solidity Smart Contracts
- `HydrogenCreditNFT.sol` — ERC-721/1155 with fractionalization
- `Marketplace.sol` — Marketplace for verified trading and credit retirement
- `IdentityRegistry.sol` — DID-based identity verification

### 2. MERN Backend
- REST APIs for issuing, trading, verifying, and retiring credits
- JWT & DID-based authentication
- Regulator and investor endpoints

### 3. React Frontend
- **Explorer Dashboard:** Search and verify hydrogen credits
- **Marketplace UI:** Trade credits securely
- **Admin/Regulator Dashboard:** Project map, credit flows, compliance data

### 4. Integration
- Smart contracts connected via **Web3.js / Ethers.js**
- Metadata and certification documents stored securely in **IPFS/S3**
- Dockerfile for deployment and environment setup

### 5. Sample Data & Demo
- Preloaded example producers, credits, and transactions for demonstration

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both **frontend** and **backend**
3. Deploy smart contracts to Ethereum/Polygon testnet
4. Run the backend server (`Node.js / Express`)
5. Launch the React frontend dashboard
6. Test issuing, trading, and verifying hydrogen credits
